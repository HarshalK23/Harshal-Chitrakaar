            android:text="Draw what you see. Start with simple objects (like the classic bowl of fruit) or common objects and progress to more complicated subjects — an intricately shaped table, for instance, or people's faces. The better you get at drawing real-life objects, the better you'll eventually be at putting ideas on paper.

    For example, let's say you get an idea for a comic book character. You can imagine every detail — the expression on their face, the emotion in their eyes, the pose that represents who this character is — but if you haven't been practicing with faces, eyes, and poses, you'll have a hard time drawing this character on paper in a way that matches with the image you have in your head.
    Instead of going big or elaborate in the beginning, focus on the small and simple. Take a bowl of fruit, or a house, or a mountain range, and practice replicating these objects with just a pencil. Draw different versions of the same thing. If you're drawing a mountain range, for example, do a little evaluation of your first drawing. Figure out what's right and what's wrong, or have a friend tell you which parts of the mountain look unnatural or need improvement. Once you have a list of the things you can improve on, draw the mountain range again. This time, improve on the parts you didn't draw well the first time. If you want after a few weeks and your drawing skills improve, draw the same picture again. See how much you've improved!
    Think of yourself as a chef. When a chef learns a new recipe, he often spends days or weeks only cooking that recipe. It makes for pretty boring eating, but he's able to perfect his dish by the end of the week. Don't get discouraged when your dish doesn't come out perfectly right away. It takes a while to get things right.
